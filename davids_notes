Data Resources:
- Coinbase API
    Why coinbase?
    Their recent initial public offering was large success. The company chose to do
    a direct listing, which in its own way, is like an initial coin offering. ICOs
    or Initial Coin Offerings are easy in today's current programming environment.
    Anyone with a little knowledge of a blockchain can code their own. Coinbase, however,
    knew that the SEC and other governing agencies were watching very closely and
    aligned their value proposition with that of a feasible, legal, and efficient
    way to get blockchain cryptocurrencies on the market. Banks like SoFi now offer access to buy into cryptocurrencies directly from the
    mobile application.

    The data from Coinbase API will provide real time prices for the cryptocurrencies
    they have listed. By using Python, Javascript, Ruby, or Curl, our team can access
    the data and integrate it into our project about NFTs, which reside on a blockchain.

    Furthermore, understanding how Coinbase's API works will benefit the students
    of the bootcamp because Coinbase currently opened brand new positions in
    Denver, Boulder, Austin, Portland, Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, San Francisco,
    Atlanta, Chicago, New York, and Raleigh for their "Asset Listing Researcher" role.

    The job duties of this role are listed below (see LinkedIn URLs):
        - Study blockchain projects to understand their use cases;
        - Research the backing technology and susceptibility to blockchain analysis;
        - Perform due diligence on UBOs, founders and project teams;
